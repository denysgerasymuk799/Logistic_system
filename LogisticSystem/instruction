If you will print in logistic_system.py:

    vehicles = [Vehicle(1), Vehicle(2)]
    logSystem = LogisticSystem(vehicles)
    my_items = [Item('book', 110), Item('chupachups', 44)]
    my_order = Order('Oleg', 'Lviv', 53, my_items)
    print(logSystem.placeOrder(my_order))
    print(logSystem.trackOrder(53797691))
    print()

    sender = Sender("Denys", "Lokhvytsia") - name, from_location
    logSystem.add_sender_to_db(my_order, sender)
    print(logSystem.make_price_for_transportation(53797691))



You will get:

    Your order number is 53797691
    None
    Your order #53797691 is sent to Lviv. Total price: 154 UAH.

    Denys, your price for transportation from Lokhvytsia to Lviv is 300 UAH, distance - 740.659 km


My work
I add class Sender and two functions in logistic_system.py:
    def add_sender_to_db(self, order: Order, sender: Sender):
        """
        Add sender to Logistic System
        """
        self.senders.append([order, sender])

    def make_price_for_transportation(self, orderId):
        """
        Make a price for transportation based on destination between from_city and city
        """
